## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

### Coin Identification
- **Use coin IDs** not symbols (symbols can be duplicated)
- **Search first**: Use searchCoins to find the correct coin_id
- **Case sensitivity**: IDs are usually lowercase (bitcoin, ethereum, etc.)

### Rate Limiting
- **Respect limits**: CoinPaprika has rate limits for API calls
- **Cache data**: Store frequently accessed data locally
- **Batch requests**: Use getTickers instead of multiple getCoinById calls

### Data Freshness
- **Ticker data**: Updated every 5 minutes
- **Historical data**: Available in various intervals (1h, 24h, 7d, 30d, 1y)
- **Events**: Check regularly for updates

### Error Handling
- **404 errors**: Coin ID not found - verify using searchCoins
- **429 errors**: Rate limit exceeded - implement backoff
- **Empty results**: Coin might be inactive or delisted
